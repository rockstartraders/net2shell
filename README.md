<h1><p align="center">
net2shell 
</p></h1>


- This is a compilation of all the network command I used.

- As always I'm lazy when it comes to typing the commands over and over again that is why I utilize the power of bash scripting.... LOL.

- I only did the automation but I am not the one who created the packages included via this script.


 ### Install Instruction: 

1. Clone the this repo. 
    #### `git clone https://github.com/rockstartraders/net2shell`

   If git is not installed just download it then extract it to your pc.
<br>
<br>
 
 2. After cloning go to the directory.

      #### `cd net2shell`

<br>
<br>

   3. Change Permission.

      #### `chmod u+x install.sh and net2shell.sh`
         If permission error occurs you know the drill  [sudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo) is the key.

<br>

   4. run the installer (this will install all the necessary package required for this script). 

      #### `./install.sh or ./install`

    Currently I am using debian base distro and using Apt as my package manager but feel free to modify it base on the package manager that you are using.  
        
<br> 

5. Just wait for it to finish then run 
      #### `./net2shell.sh or ./net2shell.sh`

<br>
